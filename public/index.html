<h1>The best movies according to Reynaldo </h1>

<h2>My top 3 favriote movies</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>

<p>Attack on titan is one of the best work of arts in my opinion, even if you do not watch anime everything connects in someway and there arnt any filler episodes </p>

<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>

<p>The reason this show sticks out to me is because i was hesitant at first but as soon as i started i couldnt stop watching. seeing how the actors react and evolve to their enivroment was really fun to watch</p>

<h3>BoJack Horseman</h3>

<p>This one is way diffrent from my other picks but i figuerd it deserved a spot because the way the show tells its story is diffrent from the rest of these shows and i reccmond it </p>

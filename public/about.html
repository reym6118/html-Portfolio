<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Reynaldo Martinez-Ramirez and i am 19 years old. I was born and rasied in a small town called Lincolnton 
which is right between the big city and the mountains. I love to self improve in all sections in my life because i belive that 
how you do one thing is how you do everything. some of my hobbies are programing, boxing, running, working out, reading, meditating,
and for some fun i play videogames but only until i work hard becsuse it makes me feel a sense of acomlishment, like i earned it. 
</p>

<p>I am an aspiring Front-end Web Developer. I am proficent in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am also instrested in learning so other stuff like
  Back-end development and eventually get into Hardware. i am taking the neccesary step to achive those goals but am not confident to say im 
  profficant at them yet.
